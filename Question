TODO:
    - Different evaluations:
        - Monte Carlo Evaluation vs Q learning
        - Different epsilon values
    - Decreasing learning rate vs non-decreasing
    - Optimal policy visualize in the grid
    - Visualize difference beteween hit or stick in the q-values for stick vs hit
    - Heatmap how many times a state was vistited
    - Show q-value of problematic states

What we have done:
    - decreasing learning rate
