TODO:
    - Different evaluations:
        - Monte Carlo Evaluation vs Q learning, Johannes
        - Different epsilon values
    - Decreasing learning rate vs non-decreasing
    - Visualize difference beteween hit or stick in the q-values for stick vs hit heatmap, Johannes
    - Visualize the states that are not optimal with a red outline, Johannes
    - Heatmap how many times a state was vistited, Nicolas
    - Show q-value of problematic states, Nicolas

DONE:
    - decreasing learning rate
